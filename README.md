# Global City Map
This project was the main and final part of the Software Engineering course.
We were a team of 4 members.

## Main idea
A system for viewing, editing, and managing city maps.
The system serves both the clients of the company and all the employees.

## Tools 
1. Modeling: Visual Paradigm
2. Programming Language: Java (IDE: Eclipse)
3. GUI Design: JavaFX Scene Builder
4. Database: MySQL

## Project Description
The system has the following screens:

1. Server Connection
2. Registration
3. Maps Catalog
4. Maps Editor Tool
5. Clients Management
6. Purchase Window
7. Client Details
8. Statistics
9. Messages Inbox

### Server Connection
Connecting to the server

### Registration Window
The Catalog can be viewed by everyone, but if the user wants to see the maps - the user should register to the system,
and become a client of the company.

These details can be changed later in the personal area.

### Maps Catalog
The catalogue has the list of all the sites and the cities that exist of the maps.

The user can search all that by sites, cities or by keywords that describe the map.

### Maps Editor Tool
This window made from 2 tabs:
1. Editing the city properties and making new travel routes that go through all the sites 

2. Editing the properties of the each map and each site on the map.

#### Editor Tool - Route View

To add a new city, or a new route in it, the user can simply choose the first option on the drop-down menu, and then all the fields are initialized.

The employee can choose an existing city, and then choose the route that the worker would like to change.

From the drop-down menu, the employee can choose a site and add it to the route, that can be viewed on the right side of the window.

#### Editor Tool - Map View

To add a new map, or a new site the user can simply choose the first option on the drop-down menu, and then all the fields are initialized.

After a map choosed, all the details are loaded to the GUI and can be edited.

On the top right side, the employee can add a site to the map.

Below that, they can edit the details of the site, save it or delete it entirely.
